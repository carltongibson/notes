## Being an open source maintainer discussion group

If you [head over to the discussions](https://github.com/carltongibson/notes/discussions) you can partake in the _Being an open source maintainer discussion group_. 

The idea there is to be part support group, part mentoring, for maintainers and prospective maintainers in the Django ecosystem. 

You're very welcome. Do [say hello](https://github.com/carltongibson/notes/discussions/29)! 


## Code of Conduct

Be pleasant. Be professional. As always. 

Folks are welcome here from all backgrounds. Respect that. Please read the Django [Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/) and [Diversity Statement](https://www.djangoproject.com/diversity/) if you're not sure what that means. 

Beyond that, I'm your host here, and so I ask you to be polite, to everyone here, as if you were in my home. If you're not, I will ask you to leave. 

Have fun! ‚ù§Ô∏è
