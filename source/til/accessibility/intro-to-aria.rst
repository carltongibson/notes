=========================
Getting started with ARIA
=========================

How to make your pages accessible to folks using assistive technologies?

Argh! No idea. The timeless advice was to use clean, semantic markup. But
beyond that, it's a bit of a mystery.

There's something about ARIA roles that you can add to your markup::

    <div role="button">Place Order</div>

But why wouldn't you just use a button there? ðŸ¤”

Then: *Argh!* â€” A long spec docâ€¦ â€”Â you know how that goes.

**But no more**, apparently.

There's a brand new `ARIA Authoring Practices Guide`_, fledgling still
but with patterns, practices, and other guides.

It has a (slightly hidden) `Start here`_. The opening section:

    No ARIA is better than Bad ARIA

This is what I need. A clear introduction. Progress. ðŸ“š

The WAI are `@w3c_wai on Twitter <@w3c_wai>`_, and have an `RSS feed`_ for the
ever-web.
