Tailwind CSS
============

I'm a big fan of the Tailwind CSS framework.

I'll leave a blank here as to the *why*… — there's plenty of that on their site.

Suffice to say, I've been using CSS since it only (half-)worked in one browser and you were *significantly* better off with a table-based layout and some spacer gifs. In all that time, it's never been the case for me that I found CSS easy to maintain. Tailwind gives me that, so I'm a fan.

Useful links
============

* `Homepage <https://tailwindcss.com>`_.
* `Documetation <https://tailwindcss.com/docs/>`_. This is the main one. ⌘K for quick search when you get there.
* `Tailwind UI <https://tailwindui.com/>`_. This is a paid add-on of components and
  templates. In my mind well worth it, and paying something back helps make sure that a
  project I'm using stays sustainable.

Icons
=====

The Tailwind folks have the _Heroicons_ set, but also useful are the _Bootstrap Icons_:

* `Heroicons <https://heroicons.com/>`_.
* `Bootstrap Icons <https://icons.getbootstrap.com/>`_.

Both let you search and then copy the SVG code to your clipboard.
