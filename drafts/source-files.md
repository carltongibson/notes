Source Files is an app by Anders..., creator of the awesome Working Copy.

It takes away the management side of git by writing straight to the GitHub API.

Nice meme...


Anders just added the ability to pick a branch to work from.

This means you can work without thinking about it, and then open a PR when you're ready
to Squash and Merge onto your main branch.

All the joy of Source Files. All tidiness of Working Copy ðŸš€
